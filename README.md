Check the github page to see the Color Scheme Generator in action: https://suebxl.github.io/color_scheme/

  In this app, you can:
  1) generate a 6 color scheme 
  2) copy the color HEX code to use it 

This is how the project looks like:

This project is done using 
- Javascript Vanilla
- the API: https://www.thecolorapi.com
- Display: grid in CSS

It really feels good to finish a project by myself :)

Color Scheme Generator is a solo project from the Frontend Developer Career Path of Scrimba (https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend)
